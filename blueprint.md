# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that showcases a modern, responsive, and beautiful UI inspired by popular travel apps like Goibibo and MakeMyTrip. The app, branded as "GoFlutter," will feature a travel booking interface.

## Style and Design

*   **Aesthetics**: The app will have a clean, vibrant, and energetic look and feel, using a modern color palette, expressive typography, and engaging iconography.
*   **Color Scheme**: The primary color will be a vibrant blue, often associated with travel and trust. I'll use a range of hues to create a visually appealing experience.
*   **Typography**: The app will use the `google_fonts` package to employ modern and readable fonts, with a clear hierarchy for headlines, body text, and other UI elements.
*   **Iconography**: I will use Material Design icons to create an intuitive and visually consistent navigation experience.
*   **Components**: The UI will be built with modern Material components, including custom-styled cards for booking, interactive buttons, and a bottom navigation bar.

## Features

*   **Travel Booking UI**: A central card-based UI for booking flights, hotels, and other travel services.
*   **Bottom Navigation**: An easy-to-use bottom navigation bar for switching between different sections of the app.
*   **Interactive Elements**: The UI will include interactive elements like text fields for destinations, date pickers, and buttons with clear calls to action.
*   **Responsive Layout**: The app is designed to be responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both mobile and web.

## Current Implementation

*   **Project Setup**: The project has been set up with the necessary dependencies, including `google_fonts` and `provider`.
*   **Basic UI Structure**: The main UI has been implemented with a `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and a `BottomNavigationBar`.
*   **Travel Booking Screen**: A `TravelBookingScreen` has been created, featuring a card-based layout for flight booking. This includes text fields for "From" and "To" locations, "Departure Date," and "Travellers."
*   **Styling**: The app uses the Lato font from `google_fonts` and a blue-based color scheme. The booking card has a modern, rounded-corner design.
*   **Date Picker**: The "Departure Date" field now opens a date picker when tapped.
*   **Interactive Traveller Counter**: The "Travellers" field is now an interactive counter with buttons to increment and decrement the number of travellers.
*   **Cabin Class Dropdown**: A dropdown menu has been added for selecting the cabin class (Economy, Business, First).
