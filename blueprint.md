# GoFlutter - Travel Booking App

## Overview

GoFlutter is a modern travel booking application inspired by leading platforms like Goibibo and MakeMyTrip. It provides a clean, intuitive user interface for booking flights, hotels, and other travel services. The app is designed to be both visually appealing and highly functional, offering a seamless user experience from start to finish.

## Style and Design

*   **Theme:** The app uses a professional and modern theme with a primary color of indigo and a clean, white background. The typography is based on the Poppins font, which is both readable and elegant.
*   **Layout:** The layout is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. The home screen features a prominent booking card for flights and hotels, followed by a grid of popular destinations. The category screens have full-screen background images and clear titles.
*   **Components:** The app uses a variety of modern UI components, including cards, sliver app bars, and a bottom navigation bar. The booking card has a subtle shadow and rounded corners, and the destination cards have a ripple effect when tapped.

## Features

*   **Home Screen:** The home screen features a booking card with options for flights, hotels, trains, and cabs. It also includes a section for popular destinations, which are displayed in a grid.
*   **Category Screens:** The app has four category screens: Beach, Mountain, City, and Forest. Each screen has a unique background image and a title that reflects the category.
*   **Navigation:** The app uses a bottom navigation bar to switch between the home, favorites, and profile screens. The category screens are accessed by tapping on the destination cards on the home screen.

## Current Plan

*   **Rebrand the app to "GoFlutter."**
*   **Redesign the home screen with a booking card and a section for popular destinations.**
*   **Enhance the category screens with titles and content.**
*   **Update the `blueprint.md` file to reflect the changes.**
